# List of TODO

- Retry resiliency is a bit raw
- Modeling could be a bit better
- No data migration model
- There's no logging
- So many clock skew problems (policy, dates, etc)
- If this fails to scale, consider adding this to a webhood + db as in Issuesof.net
- blob backed storage
- query IDs are brittle and incomplete
- commandline parsing
